# Analog Clock Reader

This code is able to read analog clocks, if adjusted well.

## Requirements
This program uses the libraries:
	* opencv
	* numpy
	* pyttsx3
	* math

## Usage
In the code itself there are comments detailing on which parts are meant to be changed to fit your clock

## Contributing
This code was made in quite a rush, and therefore has many bugs and failures (for example, if  a clock hand is facing directly downwards or upwards, there is a chance the time gets calculated incorrectly).
All pull requests are welcome, as this code is far from perfect.
